            <p>Hello, my name is John S. Could I interest you on everything, all of the time? Well perhaps a little bit
                of
                everything. Is apathy a tragedy or if boredom is a crime? If so then I suppose that is fine since I like
                what I do. </p>
            <p>I mostly do my own stuff and own projects and keep learning although I'd say it's more I build projects
                then
                learn than learn first then build projects. I just keep doing it over and over again, so it's cool. This
                is currently a portfolio website, well not really actually since it's unfinished.</p>
            <p>I'm somewhat running out of things to talk about so what else do I have to kill your time? Could I
                interest
                on anything with your time? Perhaps you could check out my projects section if you'd like to see
                something.
            </p>
